Everything around us is getting smarter day by day whether it be human beings or machines. Initially we had SmartPhones then we had SmartWatches then Smart TVs and now we are heading swiftly towards samrt home. A Smart is basically a simple home whose appliances are controllable over Wifi or Bluetooth and can be controlled from a good distance as well there is no need to be in front of the appliance or touching the appliance to control that.

The thing that we are going to make today is a DIY Smart Bulb with the help of Tuya IoT Platform and Tuya Sandwich Evaluation Kit. We will use and LED in our demo in place of a real bulb. Once the bulb is created an connected to Wifi we can control it from anywhere where Interent connectivity is available. We just need the Tuya Smart App and pair the device with it and we are ready to go.

After that we will look at Adaprox Fingerbot which is an awesome product which is created on the Tuya IoT Platform and is a part of the platform. It is a bot which can mimic the action of a human finger while toggling a switch ON or OFF. It can be controlled from the Adaprox Home App and is a very handy and useful device in our day to day life. You can also create your own products as well using the Tuya Platform as the possibilities are endless.
